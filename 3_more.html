        💌 Hey bae, <br><br>Let me start by saying how much I love tweaking to your autism. I am so happy to be tweaking together today. I am so excited for what's to come! You don't understand how much I look forward to spending every second of every day with you. It doesn't matter if we're just studying 📚, playing our games 🎮, having some cheeky time ლ(◉❥◉ ლ), or even pouting at each other 😾. I know I'm cray ಸ‿ಸ cray about you because even when things are not slaying 🙃, there isn't a second I don't want you around.<br><br> I can't imagine a moment without you by my side 👩🏽‍🤝‍👨🏻. There is no one else I'd rather go through the highs and lows of life with. I want to celebrate (while intensely twerking ( ㅅ )(✿˶’◡˘)つ) your success, comfort you through loss, and get to know you inside and out. <br><br>You are so sexy, smart, funny—I don't laugh this much with anyone else—and overall, such an amazing person and bestEST boyfriend 👩🏽‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻. Your touch is a drug to me, and OOH MANN, am I addicted to it. Sometimes, I catch a glimpse ⚆.⚆ of you, and my stomach goes queasy, and I can't believe you are all mine. ALL MINE! Being with you gives me so much motivation, hope, and comfort, and I can't wait to go through any and everything as I have your hand holding mine, gorilla grip style 🫶🏽. <br><br>This doesn't even begin to express what I feel when I see you. I have never felt this way before, and am so smitten 🫠 that my brain just stops braining sometimes. I will spend each day loving you more and more and reminding you how much you f**king mean to me 🫂. You calm my inner child, and I hope to do the same for you. I want you to feel at utmost peace with me (and with no one else *~.~*).<br><br>Alen, let me make a promise to you this Valentine's Day 🤞🏽: I am going to put everything I have into us and make this the best year of our life lives (till forever). One lifetime with you isn't enough and I know we will find each other in every single one! ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆<br><br> I love you and I just KNOW (praying aggressively) we are gonna make it 💍!<br><br> -Brinda (best gf ever) 💋
